# Still Not There Yet...

This should've been a super-quick Terraform project to showcase its power on OCI instead of AWS and test my skills, but all this project did was show me how incompetent I still am... This was more like "super-slow" because 3 hours turned into 2 days.

## How To Deploy

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install Terraform to your workstation.
3. Sign up for an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenant (*if not already*), generate an API key from your profile and use it to configure the OCI Terraform Provider.
4. Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` in the cloned/downloaded project's the root directory.
5. After provisioning is done, the terminal should show you the URL link where the web application is available.
